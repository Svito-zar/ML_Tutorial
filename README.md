# mixture-density-network

## Notebooks
* nb-mdn-inverse-normal
* nb-mdn-inverse-beta
* Regression trying showing confidence intervals outside of where data points are available (Dense) both normal and beta
* Predict mixed continuous discrete probability function in 1D [0,1]
* Try generate data using mu and sigma and try to get it back using MDN
* MDN with LSTM one-step ahead
* MDN with LSTM multiple-step ahead (sequence-to-sequence).
